# meta-backports-dunfell

This repository contains a number of Yocto recipes which have been backported from the current LTS branch (kirkstone)
to the dunfell branch in order to support in-the-field devices with updated software.

We're trying to impose minimal changes (: to _ syntax, for example) to keep track with newer development.
